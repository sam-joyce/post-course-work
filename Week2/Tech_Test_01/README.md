## Weather Cards

* Api Doc: https://openweathermap.org/current
* Api Key: 0f33f5c78acf44e7d38b5f6706f6f59d


#### Using the public OpenWeatherMap API, you need to build three cards displaying the current weather data for:

* City of London (city_id: 2643744)
* City of Bristol (city_id: 4749005)
* Rome (city_id: 4219762)


#### The cards need to display: 

1. Temperature
2. Humidity
3. Minimum temperature at the moment 
4. Maximum temperature at the moment

Default is Kelvin, but we love Celsius so can you change the measurement please.  We're interested to see some of your styling skills so please use this challenge to showcase them!


## One Question Quiz

* Create a one question quiz that validates itself and checks the user input against the correct answer. 
Eg. pizza validates true when typed in an input


## Football Team Organiser
Using the data set provided, build a component to allow users to select players from the list and create their ideal Borussia Mönchengladbach starting eleven.


#### Keep in mind:

* A user can’t insert a player more than once.
* A team can have no more than 1 Goalkeeper
* The starting eleven needs to include 3 Defenders, 4 Midfielders, 3 Attackers.


The UI should reflect the user choices.
